# Behavioral Cloning


**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals/steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track 1 without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Required Files and Quality of Code

My project includes the following files:
* `model.py` containing the script to create and train the model
* `drive.py` for driving the car in autonomous mode
* `model.h5` containing a trained convolution neural network
* `run1.mp4` video of autonomous driving
* `writeup_Haris.md` summarizing the results

#### Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my `drive.py` file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```
python drive.py model.h5
```
The `model.py` file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of convolutional layers with 5x5 and 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 24 and 64 (`model.py lines 35-39`).

The model includes RELU activations (within each convolutional layer) to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized using a Keras lambda layer (`line 33`).

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting of the model

I have used the split of 75% training data and 25% validation data of the full data set. To avoid overfitting, more data was collected and augmented by carrying out the following driving methods.
* 3 laps of center lane driving
* 1 lap of recovery driving from the sides
* 1 lap of driving smoothly around the curves

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
